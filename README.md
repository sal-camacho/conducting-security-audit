# üîê Internal Security Audit ‚Äî Botium Toys
## üß† Activity Scenario: Botium Toys Security Audit

This audit was conducted as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program to assess Botium Toys‚Äô internal security posture. Botium Toys is a small U.S. business managing both physical retail and online operations. As the company expands, its IT department faces growing pressure to secure assets, maintain compliance, and support international e-commerce demands.

### üîç Scope of the Audit

- Review the entire security program at Botium Toys
- Assess internal processes and asset management
- Evaluate controls and compliance best practices using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

### üéØ Audit Goals

- Identify and assess all IT-managed assets
- Complete the controls and compliance checklist
- Determine gaps and recommend improvements to strengthen security posture

### üß± Current Assets

- On-premises business equipment
- Employee devices (desktops, smartphones, workstations)
- Retail and warehouse inventory systems
- Software/services (accounting, telecom, database, security, ecommerce)
- Internet access and internal network infrastructure
- Data retention and legacy system management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

- **Risk Score**: 8/10 (High)
- Botium Toys lacks proper controls and may not meet U.S. and international compliance standards
- Employees currently have access to sensitive data (cardholder info, PII/SPII)
- No encryption in place for stored credit card data
- No formal access controls, backups, or centralized password policy
- No intrusion detection system (IDS)
- Physical security is in place, but system-level protections are limited

The audit follows NIST CSF's **Identify** function to evaluate risks and establish stronger security practices.

## üß† Summary

To improve its security posture and reduce regulatory risk, Botium Toys should implement the following high-priority controls and practices:

- Enforce **Least Privilege access policies** and **Separation of Duties** across teams
- Establish a **Disaster Recovery Plan** and perform **regular backups** of critical data
- Implement stronger **Password Policies** and a **Centralized Password Management System**
- Install an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to identify active threats
- Introduce **Encryption protocols** for credit card data, PII/SPII, and other sensitive assets
- Schedule and document **Legacy System Maintenance**, including formal intervention policies
- Fully classify assets based on sensitivity to enable risk-based prioritization

Botium Toys is currently compliant in areas like physical security and breach notification; however, gaps remain in PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards that must be addressed to protect customers and support future growth.
